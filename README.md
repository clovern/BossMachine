# BossMachine
This project was provided by Codecademy as part of their learn Node.js track. The front end code (all the React.js, HTML, and css) as well as most of db.js
were provided for me. I worked on the back end code for this project, creating the main server.js file and all of the Routers in the server folder (with the exception
of db.js). I also added all of the helper functions relating to the work router in db.js, since the existing functionality was not adequate for the work router.
